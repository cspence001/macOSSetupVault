Another fact - it's 100% worth it to run ethernet drops to all rooms in your house. Get a drop in every room and multiple drops in the home office (if any) and the living room.
The rule is "If it's got an ethernet port, wire it to your router/switch".
Wifi is for phones and tablets.

	* Adguard's Public DNS. In the network settings, choose manual IP configuration, and in the "DNS server" put one of the following IPs: 94.140.14.14 or 94.140.15.15 (it's safe!). It will almost block all ads. It does not block YouTube ads, for example, but in the browser and WEBOS it does. https://www.reddit.com/r/LGOLED/comments/ybs6kn/comment/ixajtds/
