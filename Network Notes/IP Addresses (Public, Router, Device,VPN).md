The information you provided suggests a typical setup involving a local area network (LAN) behind a router with a public IP address assigned by your internet service provider (ISP). Here’s a detailed explanation of what each of these IP addresses means and how they fit into your network configuration:
### Understanding the IP Addresses

1. **Public IP Address (97.146.29.152)**:
   - This is the IP address assigned to your router by your ISP, in this case, Verizon. It is the address visible to the outside world (internet).
   - ProtonVPN application on your MacBook shows this IP because, when connected to the VPN, it is verifying the public IP address that the VPN server is seeing. Since the VPN traffic exits through your ISP's network, it sees the public IP address assigned to your router by Verizon.

2. **Router IP Address (192.168.1.1)**:
   - This  is the local IP address of your router on your local network. The typical private IP address range is `192.168.x.x`. 
   - This address is used by devices within your home network (LAN) to communicate with the router. It's not visible to the external internet.

3. **Device IP Address**:
   - Your MacBook would also have an internal IP address within the `192.168.1.x` range assigned by the router (e.g., `192.168.1.2`). This is used for communication within your local network.
### Network Configuration

- **Local Network (LAN)**:
  - All devices connected to your router (e.g., your MacBook, smartphones, IoT devices) are assigned private IP addresses within the range `192.168.1.x`.
  - These devices use the router's local IP (`192.168.1.1`) as their gateway to access other networks, including the internet.

- **Router’s Role**:
  - Your router connects your local network to the internet. It translates private IP addresses to the public IP address (`97.146.29.152`) through a process called Network Address Translation (NAT).
  - When your devices access the internet, they appear to be using the public IP address assigned by Verizon.

- **VPN Usage**:
  - When you use ProtonVPN, your internet traffic is encrypted and routed through a VPN server. The VPN server sees the public IP address of your router (`97.146.29.152`).
  - The VPN assigns a different IP address to your connection, masking your actual public IP address from websites and services you access while connected to the VPN.
### Summary

- **Public IP (`97.146.29.152`)**: Assigned to your router by Verizon, visible to external services and the VPN.
- **Router IP (`192.168.1.1`)**: Local IP address of your router, used within your home network for internal communication.
- **Private IP Range (`192.168.1.x`)**: Assigned to devices on your local network by your router.

Your network setup ensures that your local devices can communicate with each other and access the internet through the public IP address provided by Verizon. The VPN adds a layer of privacy by masking your public IP address from external websites and services.
