In the ProtonVPN application, the "Allow LAN Connections" option refers to whether your device can communicate with other devices on your local area network (LAN) while connected to the VPN. Here’s a detailed explanation of what this setting does and its implications:

### Allow LAN Connections

When you enable "Allow LAN Connections" in ProtonVPN, it allows your MacBook to maintain access to local network devices and services even while the VPN is active. Here’s how it affects your network connectivity:

1. **Access Local Devices**: With this option enabled, you can still access devices on your local network, such as printers, network-attached storage (NAS), or other computers. This is useful if you need to use resources on your local network while maintaining a VPN connection for external traffic.
    
2. **Local Network Traffic**: Traffic to local IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x, 172.16.x.x - 172.31.x.x) is not routed through the VPN tunnel. Instead, it stays within the local network. Only traffic to external IP addresses goes through the VPN.
    
3. **Improved Performance for Local Traffic**: By not routing local traffic through the VPN, you can reduce latency and potentially increase the speed of accessing local network resources.
    

### Implications for Security and Privacy

1. **Local Network Security**: Enabling LAN connections can expose your device to other devices on the local network, which could be a concern if you are on a less secure or public network. Ensure your local network is trusted and secure.
    
2. **VPN Coverage**: Enabling this option means that local traffic is not encrypted by the VPN. Only traffic destined for the internet will be encrypted and routed through the VPN.

The change in ProtonVPN’s behavior where "Allow LAN Connections" is now always on in the free version likely stems from balancing functionality with security for their user base. Here are the implications of having this setting on or off, and possible reasoning behind making it always enabled on the free version:

### Implications of "Allow LAN Connections" Setting

#### When "Allow LAN Connections" is On
1. **Local Network Access**: Your device can communicate with other devices on your local network. This means you can access shared printers, files, or other services within your home or office network.
2. **Local Traffic Not Encrypted**: Traffic to local network addresses is not routed through the VPN and thus not encrypted. Only internet-bound traffic goes through the VPN tunnel.
3. **Convenience**: This setting is convenient if you rely on local network resources while using the VPN. For instance, you can print documents on a network printer without disconnecting from the VPN.
4. **Security Considerations**: While your internet traffic is secure, your local network traffic is not. If you're on a public or untrusted network, there might be a risk of local network attacks (e.g., man-in-the-middle attacks).
#### When "Allow LAN Connections" is Off
1. **No Local Network Access**: Your device will not be able to communicate with other devices on your local network while the VPN is active. This can be restrictive if you need access to local resources.
2. **All Traffic Encrypted**: All traffic, including local network traffic, is routed through the VPN. This ensures that all data packets are encrypted, offering maximum privacy and security.
3. **Inconvenience for Local Use**: You might need to disable the VPN to access local resources, which can be inconvenient and disrupt the secure tunnel for internet traffic.
### Reasoning Behind Always Enabling "Allow LAN Connections" on Free Version

1. **Simplification for Users**: Free version users might not be as tech-savvy and could benefit from a simpler setup where local network access is always available. This avoids confusion and potential support issues arising from users not understanding why they can't access local devices while the VPN is on.
2. **Network Usability**: Many free users might be using ProtonVPN in environments where they need constant access to local network resources, such as at home or in shared office spaces. Always enabling this setting ensures they can continue to use local network resources seamlessly.
3. **Resource Management**: By not encrypting local traffic, ProtonVPN can reduce the load on their VPN servers. This is particularly important for a free service where server resources are limited compared to paid tiers.
4. **Balancing Security and Functionality**: While maximum security would route all traffic through the VPN, ProtonVPN might have assessed that the trade-off is acceptable for free users, who might prioritize ease of use and local network functionality over the additional security of routing local traffic through the VPN.
### Summary
Having the "Allow LAN Connections" setting always enabled on the free version of ProtonVPN means:
- **Pros**: Users can access local network resources without having to disconnect from the VPN, ensuring a smoother user experience.
- **Cons**: Local network traffic is not encrypted, which could be a security concern on untrusted networks.

ProtonVPN likely made this decision to strike a balance between usability and security, ensuring that free users can still benefit from the VPN without facing common usability issues. If you require the ability to toggle this setting off for enhanced security, considering an upgrade to a paid plan might provide that flexibility.
