### How a VPN Works
A VPN (Virtual Private Network) creates an encrypted tunnel between your device and the VPN server. Here are the key points regarding how it affects your browsing history visibility:

1. **Encryption**: All data transmitted between your Mac and the VPN server is encrypted. This means your ISP cannot see the contents of your internet traffic.
2. **IP Address Masking**: Your ISP sees the IP address of the VPN server, not the websites or services you visit. The websites you visit see the IP address of the VPN server, not your actual IP address.
### Browsing History and ISP Visibility

When you use a VPN:
- **Encrypted Traffic**: Your ISP can see that your device is connected to a VPN server and the amount of data being transmitted. However, it cannot see the specific websites you are visiting or the content of your traffic.
- **DNS Requests**: DNS (Domain Name System) requests, which translate domain names into IP addresses, are also handled by the VPN server if the VPN is configured to use its own DNS servers. This further prevents your ISP from seeing which websites you are accessing.
### What Your ISP Can See with a VPN
- **Connection to the VPN Server**: The IP address and possibly the location of the VPN server you are connected to.
- **Amount of Data**: The volume of data being sent and received over the VPN connection.
- **Duration of Connection**: How long you are connected to the VPN.
### What Your ISP Cannot See with a VPN
- **Websites Visited**: The specific URLs or domain names you are visiting.
- **Browsing Content**: The actual content of your web traffic, including the pages you view, messages you send, and any other data exchanged.
### Limitations and Considerations
- **VPN Provider**: Your browsing history and data are hidden from your ISP but are visible to your VPN provider. Itâ€™s important to choose a trustworthy VPN provider with a strong privacy policy and no-logs policy.
- **VPN Configuration**: Ensure your VPN is properly configured to handle DNS requests and prevent leaks (e.g., DNS leaks, IPv6 leaks).
### Conclusion
Using a VPN on your Mac device effectively masks your browsing history from your ISP. While your ISP can see that you are connected to a VPN and the amount of data being transmitted, it cannot see the websites you visit or the content of your online activities. However, your VPN provider can see your browsing activities, so it's crucial to use a reputable VPN service that respects your privacy.
