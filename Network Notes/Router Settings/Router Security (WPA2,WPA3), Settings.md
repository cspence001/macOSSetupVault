**WEP** – Wired Equivalent Privacy is the oldest and the least secure Wi-Fi encryption method around since the 90s. It is not good. The encryption can be broken, and then any data you send can be read by a hacker.

**WPA/**WPA2**** – Wi-Fi Protected Access, WPA, adds an additional layer of security to WEP, but was sort of a temporary fix until WPA2. WPA2 is a common security protocol being used on routers today. Although there are some vulnerabilities, its still pretty secure. WPA2 can be either TKIP or AES. You want AES as it is the newer, more secure of the two.

**WPA3** – The latest security protocol, adds a much stronger encryption which significantly improves the security of your Wi-Fi.

1. Install the latest firmware updates for your router.
Note: you may need to [forget the network](https://macreports.com/how-to-forget-wi-fi-networks-on-mac/) on your device after changing your router’s settings to be sure your device will use the new settings when joining the network.

- Use a unique name for your network. Don’t use the name that came with your router, such as linksys or netgear. This will make sure you don’t accidentally connect to other networks with the same name as yours.
- Use the same name for your 2.4 GHz and 5GHz bands.
- Don’t hide your network name. Keep this feature disabled.

- Set a strong password to join the network.
- Choose WPA3. Unless you can’t, because you have older devices that don’t support it.
- Choose WPA2/WPA3 if you can’t choose WPA3. This mixed mode allows older devices to use WPA2 and devices that support WPA3 to use the stronger protocol.
- Choose WPA2 (AES) if WPA3 and WPA2/WPA3 aren’t compatible with your devices.
- Don’t use None, Open or Unsecured for your security settings, even for a guest network.

### Other Router Settings

#### MAC address Filtering, Authentication and Access Control
Disable this feature. It doesn’t do much to enhance your security and it can make it difficult to connect your devices.
#### Automatic Firmware Updates
You may want to enable automatic firmware updates to ensure that your router always has the latest updates.
#### Radio Mode
The options in this setting are Wi-Fi 2 – Wi-Fi 6 or 802.11a/g/n/ac/ax. You should usually open all of these to allow devices to connect via the fastest mode they support.
#### Bands
Open both bands; no reason not to. The 2.4 GHz band may have a better range whereas the 5 GHz will be faster when you are within its range.
#### Channel
Each of the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands will use a channel. If you have neighbors using, say, channel 6 for their 2.4 GHz band, you won’t want to use that one, due to interference. Interference can significantly affect your network’s performance. Usually setting the channel selection to Auto will work best. It allows your router to find the best band to use.
