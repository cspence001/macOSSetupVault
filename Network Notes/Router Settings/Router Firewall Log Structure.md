   - **Destination**: 17.57.147.4 (external IP)
   - **Action**: Packet marked as illegal.
   - **Reason**: TCP packet with flags ACK, PSH, FIN.

### General Interpretation
- **Pkt_Illegal**: Indicates that the firewall has identified these packets as non-compliant or suspicious, possibly due to the combination of TCP flags, unusual traffic patterns, or mismatched state in the connection.
- **ACK, FIN, PSH, RST Flags**: These flags are related to the control of TCP connections. Frequent occurrences of these flags, especially in combinations like ACK+FIN or ACK+PSH+FIN, could indicate port scans, attempts to close connections, or other anomalies.
- **IPv6 Addresses**: Noteworthy as they indicate the use of IPv6, which might need specific rules or considerations in your firewall configuration.
- **Consistent Source Addresses**: Multiple logs from the same source could indicate a persistent issue or targeted scanning.
### Recommendations
1. **Review Firewall Rules**: Ensure that the firewall rules are correctly configured to handle expected traffic and block suspicious patterns.
2. **Monitor Network Traffic**: Keep an eye on the traffic to and from the highlighted IP addresses for any unusual behavior.
3. **Investigate Specific Sources**: Check the devices corresponding to the local IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.188) for malware or misconfigurations.
4. **Adjust Logging Levels**: If these events are expected and not harmful, consider adjusting the logging levels to reduce noise.

Understanding and addressing these logs can help in maintaining network security and ensuring that legitimate traffic is not being wrongly flagged.

### Log Breakdown (example)

The firewall logs from your router indicate that several packets were flagged as "illegal" by the IP tables firewall. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key information in each log entry and what it might mean:

1. **General Format**:
    - `IN=br-lan OUT=ccmni2`: The packet entered through the `br-lan` interface (typically your local network bridge) and exited through the `ccmni2` interface (likely a cellular modem or similar WAN interface).
    - `PHYSIN=ra2` or `ra0`: The physical network interface that received the packet.
    - `MAC=ac:b6:87:32:c0:c0:...`: MAC address details for source and destination.
    - `SRC=... DST=...`: Source and destination IP addresses.
    - `LEN=...`: Packet length.
    - `PROTO=TCP`: The protocol used, in this case, TCP.
    - `SPT=... DPT=...`: Source and destination ports.
    - Flags (e.g., `ACK`, `FIN`, `PSH`, `RST`): TCP control flags.

2. **Specific Logs**:
    - **Log Entry 1**:
      ```

      - A packet coming in from the `ccmni2` interface with the source address `54.226.11.35` (a public IP) to `97.146.29.152` (another public IP), flagged as illegal with a reset (RST) flag.

    - **Log Entry 5**:
      ```
      (2)[22499:arc_cloud][FW] IPTABLES [Pkt_Illegal] IN=br-lan OUT=ccmni2 PHYSIN=ra2 MAC=ac:b6:87:32:c0:c0:ec:8a:c4:77:f8:55:86:dd SRC=2600:1003:a410:1af3:980a:cb0a:b152:e8e9 DST=2600:1f18:1a46:b100:1d54:3856:89e4:e03f LEN=72 TC=0 HOPLIMIT=63 FLOWLBL=96964 PROTO=TCP SPT=41650 DPT=80 WINDOW=1350 RES=0x00 ACK FIN URGP=0
      ```
      - Another IPv6 packet similar to previous entries, targeting port 80.

    - **Log Entry 6**:
      ```
      (0)[0:swapper/0][FW] IPTABLES [Pkt_Illegal] IN=br-lan OUT=ccmni2 PHYSIN=ra0 MAC=ac:b6:87:32:c0:c0:3a:a7:9e:57:2a:fe:08:00 SRC=192.168.1.188 DST=17.57.147.4 LEN=108 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=63 ID=0 DF PROTO=TCP SPT=63387 DPT=5223 WINDOW=2048 RES=0x00 ACK PSH FIN URGP=0
      ```
      - Similar to Log Entry 2, another packet from your local network to the same destination, flagged as illegal.

**Possible Reasons for Flagging**:
- **Malformed Packets**: The packets might be malformed or contain invalid headers.
- **Unusual Flags**: The combination of TCP flags (e.g., ACK, FIN, PSH) might be unusual or suspicious.
- **Security Policies**: The firewall rules may flag certain types of traffic (e.g., specific source/destination ports, IP addresses, or protocols) as potentially harmful.
- **Spoofed Addresses**: Packets might be using spoofed IP addresses, raising red flags in the firewall.

**Next Steps**:
- **Check Firewall Rules**: Review your IP tables rules to understand why these packets are being flagged.
- **Network Monitoring**: Use tools like Wireshark to capture and analyze the flagged traffic for any anomalies.
- **Update Firmware**: Ensure your router firmware is up-to-date to prevent false positives and enhance security.

Understanding these logs can help you identify and mitigate potential security issues in your network.
