###### separate scripts and dotfiles
**Scripts**
Definition:
- Scripts are files containing a series of commands written in a scripting language (like Bash, Python, Perl, etc.) that automate tasks.
Purpose:
- Scripts are used to automate repetitive tasks, execute complex commands, manage system processes, or perform a series of operations.
**Dotfiles**
Definition:
- Dotfiles are configuration files that are used to set up and customize the behavior of applications, shells, or the operating system. They are named with a leading dot (`.`) to make them hidden by default.
Purpose:
- Dotfiles are used to configure user environments, such as shell settings, editor preferences, and other application configurations.
**Summary**
Scripts are for automating tasks and running commands.
Dotfiles are for configuring and customizing your environment and applications.
