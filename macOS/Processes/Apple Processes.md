text-based search interface of system shell commands and service descriptions in macOS.
### Internals

#### [apple-internals site](https://mroi.github.io/apple-internals/)
Information on apple system processes, text-based search interface 
#### [apple-internals repo](https://github.com/mroi/apple-internals)
This repository provides tools and information to help understand and analyze the internals of Appleâ€™s operating system platforms. Information is collected in a text file andÂ [presented on a website](https://mroi.github.io/apple-internals). AÂ [Nix flake](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes)Â allows to build the following externally hosted tools:

[**acextract**](https://github.com/bartoszj/acextract)  
Unpacks asset catalogs to individual files.
[**dyld-shared-cache-util**](https://github.com/antons/dyld-shared-cache-big-sur)  
Extracts dynamic libraries from the dyld linker cache.
[**snapUtil**](https://github.com/ahl/apfs)  
Manages APFS snapshots.

The Makefile aggregates various kinds of information from the system in a SQLite database and checks the internals text file against this information. Collected details include:

- all file names of the installed macOS and the iOS, tvOS, and watchOS simulators
- linkages of binaries to libraries
- entitlements for all executables
- plain-text strings embedded in binaries
- launchd service descriptions and bundle Info.plist content
- lists of assets inside asset catalogs
