**Script Functionality**

- **List Applications**: Using the `--list` flag, the script displays all applications in `/Applications/`, `/System/Applications/`, and `/System/Applications/Utilities`.
- **Extract Application Information**: Using the `--app` flag with `<AppPath>`
	- When using terminal include quotes around application pathname if it includes spaces.
- **Extracted Information**:
    - **CDHash**: Identifies code signatures.
    - **Team Identifier**: Developer's team ID.
    - **SHA-256 Hash**: Cryptographic hash of the executable.
    - **Bundle ID**: Unique application identifier.
    - **Code Requirement**: Application signature requirements.
    - **Name**: Application Name
    - **Path**: Path to the Application's binary executable on macOS device

You have three options for identifying an app for blocking: `name`, `path,` or `bundleID`. Although it is possible to also use `sha256` or `cdhash`, these can produce less consistent results. 
For example, by using `path`: Your end users might install the app in an alternative location on their device. If the app is launched from that alternative location, the restriction profile might not work as expected.
When creating your XML, you can use `name`, `path` or `bundleID`, or all three as an additional precaution.

```xml
<dict>
	<key>name</key> 
	<array>
		<string>Google Chrome</string> 
		<string>FaceTime</string> 
		<string>Calculator</string>
	</array> 
	<key>path</key> 
	<array>
	<string>/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome</string>
	<string>/System/Applications/FaceTime.app/Contents/MacOS/FaceTime</string>     <string>/System/Applications/Calculator.app/Contents/Mac0S/Calculator</string>     </array> 
	<key>bundleId</key> 
	<array>
		<string>com.google.Chrome</string> 
		<string>com.apple.FaceTime</string> 
		<string>com.apple.calculator</string>
	</array> 
</dict>
```

**Potential Use Cases**

- **Application Integrity Verification**: Use the script to verify application integrity through code signatures, hashes, and to identify potential threats.
- **Application Management and Inventory Tracking**: Quickly gather and manage information about installed applications for effective oversight and policy enforcement.
- **Security Compliance**: Ensure applications meet security standards and requirements, aiding in compliance efforts.
- **Forensics and Incident Response**: Identify altered or tampered applications for forensic analysis and rapid response to security incidents.
- **Documentation and Reporting**: Generate comprehensive reports on application status, compliance, and security metrics for ongoing audits and assessments.
- **Configuration Management**: Extract application information to populate fields for Custom XML Payloads in `.mobileconfig` files or plists, aiding in the management of macOS settings and policies.


**Code requirement**: Code signature for the application or process.
A code signature is created when an app or binary is signed by a developer certificate.
**static code validation**: for the app or process to statically validate the code requirement.

```xml
<key>SystemPolicyAllFiles</key> 
     <array> 
     <dict> 
     <key>Allowed</key> 
     <true/> 
     <key>CodeRequirement</key> 
	 <string>identifier "com.crowdstrike.falcon.Agent" and anchor apple 
      generic and certificate 1[field.1.2.840.113635.100.6.2.6] and      
      certificate leaf[field.1.2.840.113635.100.6.1.13] and 
      certificate leaf[subject.OU] = "X9E956P446"</string>      
	 <key>Comment</key> 
     <string></string> 
     <key>Identifier</key> 
	 <string>com.crowdstrike.falcon.Agent</string> 
	 <key>IdentifierType</key> 
     <string>bundleID</string>
     <key>X9E956P446</key>
```

**Privacy Preferences Policy Control (PPPC)** payloads are used for granting certain applications access, for example to files or microphone/camera. Enforcing a PPPC payload negates the need for intervention from an Admin to grant access to certain apps that may require extra accessibility privileges such as SentinelOne or Sophos. Before we start creating a **PPPC** payload we will need to get the **Bundle Identifier** and the **Code Requirement** of the application we are giving extended access to.

**Note**: We recommend having only one PPPC payload per software as multiple PPPC payloads for the same software may conflict and cause unwanted behavior.

The Privacy Preferences payload controls the settings that are displayed in `System Settings > Privacy & Security:

[Settings and Configurations for App Permissions Profile](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/configuration/device-restrictions-macos#privacy-preferences)
On macOS devices, apps and processes often prompt users to allow or deny access to device features, such as the camera, microphone, calendar, Documents folder, and more. These settings allow administrators to pre-approve or pre-deny access to these device features. When you configure these settings, you manage data access consent on behalf of your users. Your settings override their previous decisions.
The goal of these settings is to reduce the number of prompts by apps and processes.

Preferences that can be changed and the control options accordingly:

To protect user privacy, Apple has not made some preferences configurable to ‘Allow’, such as the camera functionality. Some preferences — for example, screen recording — cannot be enabled by MDM, but we can change this permission so standard users can change the setting without local administrator privileges.

* Note: Using `tccutil` manages the privacy database which stores decision the user has made about whether apps may access personal data. You will need to disable any active PPPC policies if using `tccutil` to reset or unset permissions. See [[TCC db]]
