review [[Application Bundles + Restrictions]]

fix Jupyter setup in vscodium / reset python config


add `dscl` ref to [[homebrew Permissions + Ownership]] **opened

Write script similar to microsoft telem but with options: 
 * add to `update_host.py`: process to check for updated source files in directory from link (list  subscription feature)
 * Retain copies of hosts file sources - for easier addition/removal/update
 * add removal argument based on local list`-r /path/to/list.txt` or based on url `-ru http://example.com/hosts.txt` etc.
 * removal from /etc/hosts directly `-rh apple_domains2.txt`
 * fix listing of added sources in log file - if removed, /active, etc. - logic when hosts restored from backup - restored timestamp - which files were added before 
 * gui version
	 * option for sources

Brave Filters App- 
- Import Custom Filter List, Compare to Active Brave Filters (Compare Button) - shows overlapped filters (Name of Filter List, Color Indicating Duplicate (Red), Color Indicating New (Green) ✅
	- Yellow / light blue (exists in new custom list)

- When adding New filters - ensure My Active/ My Custom have been selected for comp ✅
	- automatically enables if disabled(add note)
- Note: Compare Filters based on Current Result (If Filtered by Keyword, etc)

1. **Error Handling**: Improve error messages to provide more context. For example, if loading filters fails, indicate which file or operation caused the issue.
2. **User Experience**:
    - Provide feedback during long operations (like fetching content) by disabling buttons or showing a loading spinner.
    - Consider using a more sophisticated logging system instead of just printing errors to the console. This will help in debugging.
3. **Performance**:
    - When loading filters or content, consider using threads or async calls to avoid freezing the GUI during network operations.
    - Caching mechanisms could be implemented to avoid redundant fetch operations for URLs.
4. **Testing**:
    - Make sure to test the application thoroughly with various filter formats and scenarios to ensure it handles edge cases gracefully.
    - Syntax Check 
1. **Documentation**: Add comments or a README file explaining how to set up and use the application, especially for users who may not be familiar with Python or Tkinter.
2. **Cleanup Functionality**: Ensure the `cleanup_local_content()` function doesn't accidentally remove important files if used incorrectly.
