https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/

The GitHub issue [#5007](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/5007) discusses the user's desire for a more straightforward way to activate a `pipenv` virtual environment directly in the current shell, rather than spawning a new shell with `pipenv shell`.
### User's Request
- **Problem**: The user wants a `pipenv` command that activates the virtual environment in the current shell session, similar to how `source` works with traditional virtual environments.
- **Current Solution**: The user currently uses a workaround involving shell commands to activate the environment, but finds it less intuitive, especially for less experienced users.
### Proposed Solution
- The user proposes adding a new command `pipenv activate` that would source the virtual environment activation script directly, allowing activation within the current shell session without spawning a new shell.
### Alternative Suggested by the Answer
- **Shell Alias or Function**: Instead of adding a new `pipenv` command, the provided solution suggests creating a shell alias or function to achieve this functionality:
  ```bash
  source $(pipenv --venv)/bin/activate
  ```
  - This command sources the `activate` script from the virtual environment created by `pipenv`, allowing the user to activate the environment in the current shell session.
### Summary
- **User's Objective**: Simplify the process of activating a `pipenv` virtual environment in the current shell session.
- **Proposed Feature**: A new `pipenv activate` command.
- **Suggested Workaround**: Use a shell alias or function to source the `activate` script from the `pipenv` virtual environment.

The GitHub issue highlights the need for a more user-friendly approach to virtual environment activation in `pipenv`, and while the maintainers have not implemented this feature, the suggested workaround offers a practical solution for those familiar with shell scripting.

Activating a `pipenv` virtual environment directly in the current shell versus spawning a new shell with `pipenv shell` has several practical differences and implications:

### Activating a `pipenv` Virtual Environment Directly in the Current Shell

#### Suggested Approach:
```bash
source $(pipenv --venv)/bin/activate
```

**Pros:**
1. **Current Shell Session**:
   - Activates the virtual environment within the current shell session, meaning that the environment variables and `PATH` changes apply immediately to the current shell without needing to switch to a new shell.
2. **Integration with Scripts**:
   - Allows easier integration with scripts and other commands that need to operate within the activated environment without changing the shell context.
3. **Simplicity**:
   - May simplify interactions for users who prefer not to switch shells, making it easier to run commands and scripts directly.
4. **Containerized Environments**:
   - More compatible with containerized environments or other scenarios where spawning a new shell might be problematic or less practical.
**Cons:**
1. **Manual Setup**:
   - Requires setting up an alias or function, which might be less intuitive for some users, especially those unfamiliar with shell scripting.
2. **Less Isolation**:
   - The current shell session remains active, which might lead to confusion if the environment is not managed carefully (e.g., if multiple environments are activated or switched frequently).
### Spawning a New Shell with `pipenv shell`

#### Using `pipenv shell`:
```bash
pipenv shell
```

**Pros:**
1. **Isolation**:
   - Provides a completely isolated environment by spawning a new shell with the virtual environment activated. This helps to ensure that no environment variables or configurations from the parent shell interfere with the virtual environment.
2. **Automatic Management**:
   - Automatically manages the activation and deactivation of the environment. Once you exit the new shell, the environment is deactivated, returning you to the parent shell with its original settings.
3. **Environment-Specific Configuration**:
   - Ensures that all commands run within the new shell are executed with the environment settings and dependencies specified by `pipenv`.
**Cons:**
1. **Switching Contexts**:
   - Requires switching to a new shell, which can be cumbersome if you need to run a series of commands in the same environment.
2. **Compatibility Issues**:
   - Might not work well in environments where spawning a new shell is problematic (e.g., certain containerized or restricted environments).
### Why the User Wants Direct Activation
1. **Convenience**:
   - Direct activation within the current shell is often more convenient for users who need to run multiple commands or scripts sequentially without the overhead of managing multiple shell sessions.
2. **Compatibility**:
   - Spawning a new shell may not always be practical in environments like containers or certain automated systems where shell spawning is limited or behaves differently.
3. **Integration**:
   - Some workflows and automation scripts require commands to run in the same shell context as other scripts or commands. Direct activation ensures that all commands can be run within the same session.
4. **Intuitiveness**:
   - The suggested approach might be more intuitive for users familiar with traditional virtual environments who are used to activating environments directly within their current shell.

In summary, the main difference is that direct activation keeps the user in the same shell session, allowing seamless and immediate use of the virtual environment, while `pipenv shell` provides isolation by spawning a new shell. The user prefers direct activation for convenience, compatibility, and ease of integration with existing workflows.
