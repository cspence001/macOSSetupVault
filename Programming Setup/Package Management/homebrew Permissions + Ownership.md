These notes address permissions and ownership issues for Homebrew installations, emphasizing user-specific versus multi-user setups. They highlight the importance of proper permissions for `/usr/local/bin`, outline security risks, and suggest alternatives like installing Homebrew in a user's home directory or using a dedicated user group. Commands for adjusting ownership and a comparison of installation methods are also included.

### Permissions and Ownership

- **Check Permissions**:
  ```sh
  cd /usr/local/bin
  ls -ls
  ```

- **Homebrew Package vs. Script Install**: [Recursive Permissions Change](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/17498)

- **Ensure Proper Permissions**:
  - `/usr/local/bin` affects all users. (see below about installing Homebrew in the home folder).

**Original Permissions**:
```bash
sudo chown root:wheel /usr/local/bin /usr/local/sbin
sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin /usr/local/sbin
```

**Homebrew suggested: Change ownership of /usr/local/bin to user**:
```sh
sudo chown -R $(whoami) $(brew --prefix)/*
```

### Homebrew Install Location and Permissions: Concerns

**Homebrew User**: Typically installed for a single user; for multi-user access, install in directories owned by root. [Discussion StackExchange](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/435688)

**Homebrew Directory Concerns**: [Directory/Permissions StackOverflow](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/1395)
  - Consider creating an alternate user and installing Homebrew with `sudo -U homebrew`.
  
**Homebrew Ownership & PATH**:
 - Homebrew changes ownership of `/usr/local/bin` to the user, this is a system-wide directory, impacting all users. 
	 - Allowing a non-root user to own a system-wide directory means that if the user or a process running under that user account is compromised, the attacker could modify or install malicious binaries that all users could execute.
	 - **Dependency on User Privileges**: If a malicious package is installed, it can potentially manipulate other system-wide binaries or configurations.
 - Homebrew suggests placing `/usr/local/bin` ahead of system bins in `$PATH` However, having anything ahead of the system bins is discouraged unless it’s also `root:wheel` protected. [Reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/PrivacyGuides/comments/vashs2/comment/ic7w0b6)
 - See [how Homebrew invites users to get pwned](https://applehelpwriter.com/2018/03/21/how-homebrew-invites-users-to-get-pwned/). 

**Suggested Solution:** Install Homebrew in a different location (within your home folder)
1. Reset the permissions of `/usr/local/bin` back to `wheel`:
   ```sh
   sudo chown root:wheel /usr/local/bin
   ```
2. Reinstall Homebrew and choose a location within your home folder.

**More Solutions below.** [[#Homebrew Install Location and Permissions Alternatives]]

**Homebrew's Installation and Sudo Policy**:
- Homebrew typically requires `sudo` for its initial installation to set up directories like `/usr/local`. However, once installed, it does not need administrative rights for routine operations. 
- Homebrew employs macOS sandboxing to mitigate risks, but this is ineffective when commands are executed as the root user, who has unrestricted access to the entire system. 
- Users can also install Homebrew entirely without root privileges. See more [here](https://docs.brew.sh/FAQ#why-does-homebrew-say-sudo-is-bad).

### Homebrew Install Location and Permissions: Alternatives
#### 1. Install Homebrew in a Different Location (Home Folder)
##### Commands:
```bash
# Reset permissions of /usr/local/bin
sudo chown root:wheel /usr/local/bin
sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin

# Reinstall Homebrew in a user directory
```
**Result (Original Permissions)**:
```sh
/usr/local $ ls -ls
total 0
0 drwxr-xr-x  10 root    wheel  320 Sep 13 12:45 bin
```

**Implications**:
- **User Isolation**: Installing Homebrew in a user-specific location (e.g., `~/homebrew`) keeps all packages, binaries, and configurations contained to that user’s environment, preventing impacts on others.
- **Security**: This setup reduces risks associated with global installations since other users cannot interfere with or access the Homebrew installation.
- **Path Management**: Ensure your `$PATH` prioritizes the new Homebrew installation, requiring updates to shell configuration files (e.g., `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`).
- **Compatibility**: Pre-built binary packages (bottles) may not be available for a non-default installation prefix, potentially requiring more frequent builds from source.

#### 2. Allow Admins to Manage Homebrew's Local Install Directory

On macOS, the `admin` group includes all admin users (those who can `sudo`). Running `chown -R …:admin` along with `chmod -R g+w /usr/local` grants write access to all `admin` group members, enabling collaborative use of `/usr/local`/`brew` on multi-user systems. [Ref](https://stackoverflow.com/a/16450503)

**Implications**:
- **Shared Management**: Granting write permissions to the `admin` group allows multiple users to manage Homebrew installations collaboratively.
- **Increased Risk**: This approach introduces risks since any admin can modify or remove packages, potentially leading to inconsistencies.
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Admins must be cautious about their actions, as changes could affect others.

##### Commands:
##### `"$USER":admin`
```bash
sudo chown -R "$USER":admin /usr/local
#grants write permissions to the group for `/usr/local`
sudo chmod -R g+w /usr/local
```
- Changes ownership of `/usr/local` and its contents recursively to the current user and sets the group to `admin`.

**Result**:
```sh
/usr/local $ ls -ls
total 0
0 drwxrwxr-x  10 john    admin  320 Sep 13 12:45 bin
```

**Implications**:
- **Ownership Change**: Full control granted to the specified user while giving write access to the admin group.
- **Permissions**: The `chmod` command adds write permissions for the group, enabling all members to modify `/usr/local`.

##### `:admin`
```bash
sudo chown -R :admin /usr/local
#grants write permissions to the group for `/usr/local`
sudo chmod -R g+w /usr/local
```
- Changes the group ownership of `/usr/local` and its contents to `admin`, leaving the owner unchanged. It'll work the same for any admin user of the machine.
- Assign the users who should have access to `brew` command to that group (check your groups via: `dscl . -read /groups/admin GroupMembership` ).

**Result**:
```sh
/usr/local $ ls -ls
total 0
0 drwxrwxr-x  10 root    admin  320 Sep 13 12:45 bin
```

**Implications**:
- **Ownership Change**: Group ownership to `admin` allows collaboration while keeping root ownership intact, safeguarding against accidental deletions.
- **Access Control**: This option mitigates risks associated with multiple users modifying critical directories.

The admin solutions mentioned are similar to the proposed fix for the permissions error when installing Node with Homebrew. Below are the specific permissions needed to resolve the Node issue:

**Fixes Node Issue**:
```sh
sudo chown -R `whoami`:admin /usr/local/include/node
sudo chown -R `whoami`:admin /usr/local/bin
sudo chown -R `whoami`:admin /usr/local/share
sudo chown -R `whoami`:admin /usr/local/lib/dtrace 
```

#### 3. Create a Group `brew` and Add Users
##### Commands:
```bash
sudo chgrp -R brew /usr/local
sudo chmod -R g+w /usr/local
```

**Implications**:
- **Controlled Access**: Creating a dedicated group (e.g., `brew`) controls who can manage Homebrew installations, allowing specific users access without blanket admin rights.
- **Granular Permissions**: Provides specific control over who can install or modify packages, limiting write access to group members.
- **Usability**: Maintains shared installation advantages while minimizing misuse potential. Proper management of group membership is essential.

#### 4.`.zshrc`/`bash` Solution 
##### Commands in `.zshrc`:
```bash
alias brew='sudo -Hu bob /opt/homebrew/bin/brew'
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
fpath+=("/opt/homebrew/share/zsh/site-functions")
```
This solution is effective for individual users who wish to manage Homebrew without affecting system-wide settings or security.

**Implications:**
- **User-Specific Control**: The `brew` command runs as user `bob`, allowing him to manage packages without changing ownership of system directories.
- **Security**: Reduces risks by limiting management to one user, avoiding shared access complications.
- **Simplicity**: Keeps Homebrew isolated in a designated directory (`/opt/homebrew`), simplifying management while using Homebrew’s features.
- **Usability**: Users can run Homebrew commands without needing elevated permissions each time, enhancing user-friendliness.
